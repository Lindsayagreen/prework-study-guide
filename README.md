# <Coding Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description 

This is simple guide introducing the aspects of the 3 main web languages. I focused on the main terms and aspects of each language. This project was built for personal review as well as to add-on to as I gain more experience in coding. This website allows me to return to previous discussed topics to review and expand on in the future. I learned the basics of coding a webpage. It conatins notes on HTML, Css, Git, and JavaScript

To use this study guide, there are sections addressing each major aspect of what the pre-work went over. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
